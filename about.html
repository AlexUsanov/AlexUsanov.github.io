        <!-- Intro -->
        
                <p>The Walnut Street Café opened for business on June 11 1996 at 5am. Located in West Lynn, The Walnut Street Café is a cozy spot that boast live music, a fireplace, and comfortable seating that makes you feel right at home while enjoying our freshly made treats. We serve a variety of domestic and imported beers and wines and dozens of flavors of iced and hot coffee, club sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, and bagels.

 

The Daily Item voted us #1 Coffee Shop for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, a seven-year winning streak. We thank our loyal customers for this honor. In a town with over a dozen locations for a certain chain we will not name, this is no small feat. We are also famous for our monster muffins made fresh throughout the day. We will soon be adding coffee drinks and blender drinks to our beer and wine selection.
